# Sports Analyst - Data Analysis and Feature Engineering for Sports Insights

## Description
This project provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing sports data, with an emphasis on feature engineering and data manipulation. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from raw sports data, build predictive models, and visualize results. The analysis includes steps such as data preprocessing, feature creation, and model building, aimed at deriving actionable insights for sports analysts, teams, and fans.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sports-analyst.git
   cd sports-analyst
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Make sure you have a working Python environment (Python 3.x).

## Usage

1. **Load your dataset**: Place your dataset in the `data/` folder and load it using the provided Python scripts.
2. **Feature Creation**: Run the script `feature_creation.py` to process the raw data into features suitable for analysis.
3. **Modeling**: Use `model_building.py` to train and evaluate predictive models.
4. **Visualization**: Visualize the results using the `visualization.py` script.

### Example

```python
import pandas as pd
from feature_creation import create_features
from model_building import build_model

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('data/sports_data.csv')

# Create features
features = create_features(data)

# Build a model
model = build_model(features)
```

## Support

## Roadmap
- **Version 1.0**: Initial feature creation and data preprocessing.
- **Version 2.0**: Model building and evaluation framework.
- **Version 3.0**: Advanced visualization and reporting tools.
